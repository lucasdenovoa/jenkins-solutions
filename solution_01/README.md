## Git Clone Shell Script

You must create an script called ```gitLab.sh``` that must have a function called ```clonaRepo``` that will recieve 3 parameters:
 * repository
 * user
 * branch

As a result, a git repo must be sucessfully cloned.
This function must clone any existing repository, in any existing branch.

```bash
$> clonaRepo <repository> <user> <branch>
```
